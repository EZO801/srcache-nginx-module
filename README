Name
    ngx_srcache - Transparent subrequest-based caching layout for
            arbitrary nginx locations

    *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the
    installation instructions.

Status
    This module is experimental and still under active development.

Synopsis

    location /foo {
        set $key $uri;
        srcache_fetch GET /memc $key;
        srcache_store PUT /memc $key;

        # proxy_pass/fastcgi_pass/drizzle_pass/echo/etc...
        # or even static files on the disk
    }

    location /memc {
        set $memc_key $query_string;
        set $memc_exptime 300;
        memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
    }

Description
    This module provides a transparent caching layer for
    arbitrary nginx locations (like those use an upstream
    or even serve static disk files).

    Usually, the ngx_memc module is used together with
    this module to provide a concrete caching storage backend.
    But technically, any modules that provide a REST
    interface can be used as the fetching and storage subrequests
    used by ngx_srcache.

Directives
    srcache_fetch

    srcache_store

    srcache_store_max_size (TODO)

Installation
    1. Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (< http://nginx.net/ >), for
        example, the version 0.8.29 (see nginx compatibility), 
    2. and then build the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.29/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/srcache-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    srcache-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/srcache-nginx-module/downloads>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.0 ~ 0.8.41

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.46 (last tested version is 0.7.67)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x, as well as
    latest nginx 0.8.42+  will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.44 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

Report Bugs
    Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
    there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
    whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to

    1.  send a bug report or even patches to <agentzh@gmail.com>,

    2.  or create a ticket on the issue tracking interface
        (<http://github.com/agentzh/srcache-nginx-module/issues>)
        provided by GitHub.

    Available on github at agentzh/srcache-nginx-module

ChangeLog

Test Suite
    This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The test cases
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/srcache-nginx-module/tree/master/test/t
    />) are declarative
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/srcache-nginx-module/blob/master/test/t
    /sanity.t>) too. Thanks to the Test::Base
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base>) module in the Perl world.

    To run it on your side:

        $ cd test
        $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-srcache-module:$PATH prove -r t

    You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite
    if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

    Because a single nginx server (by default, "localhost:1984") is used
    across all the test scripts (".t" files), it's meaningless to run the
    test suite in parallel by specifying "-jN" when invoking the "prove"
    utility.

    Some parts of the test suite requires modules rewrite, and echo
    to be enabled as well when building Nginx.
